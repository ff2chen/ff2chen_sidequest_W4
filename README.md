## Description

Based on example 3, creates and positions the player using preloads and loadJSON files.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.

Fei Fei edited some parts of the code using AI but changed parts in sketch.js.
